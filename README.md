# VHDL-SineWaveGenerator

This is VHDL Code for the DE10-Lite FPGA Board. The DE10-Lite uses the Intel Altera MAX 10 FPGA.

When the board pins are connected to a voltage divider and low-pass filter (consisting of a resistor and capacitor of choice), an oscilloscope will be able to display a clean sine wave. The sine wave is built using a lookup table which is incremented with a counter.

Through the use of buttons, the frequency and amplitude of this sine wave may be increased or decreased by changing the increment.

Completed as the final project (5th practical lab) for ENEL 453 - Digital Systems Design
